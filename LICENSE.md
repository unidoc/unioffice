## Licensing Information

This library (UniDoc unioffice) has a dual license, a commercial one suitable for closed source projects and an
AGPL license that can be used in open source software.

Depending on your needs, you must choose one of them and follow its policies. A detail of the policies
and agreements for each license type are available in the [LICENSE.COMMERCIAL](LICENSE.COMMERCIAL)
and [LICENSE.AGPL](LICENSE.AGPL) files.

In brief, purchasing a license is mandatory as soon as you develop activities
distributing the unioffice software inside your product or deploying it on a network
without disclosing the source code of your own applications under the AGPL license.
These activities include:

 * offering services as an application service provider or over-network application programming interface (API)
 * creating/manipulating documents for users in a web/server/cloud application
 * shipping unioffice with a closed source product

Please see [pricing](http://unidoc.io/pricing) to purchase a commercial license or contact sales at sales@unidoc.io
for more info.
