***Announcement (2019/04/29): UniDoc aquires gooxml.*** [UniDoc](https://unidoc.io) (https://unidoc.io and https://github.com/unidoc) has aquired gooxml from Baliance and we plan to add it to our suite of document format support for Go.

The repository (gooxml) will be moving to a new home: https://github.com/unidoc/unioffice and the package name will be come `unioffice`.

This will require updating import paths of existing code to `github.com/unidoc/unioffice`.  This move will take place in the weekend of the 5th of May.

**gooxml** is a library for creation of Office Open XML documents (.docx, .xlsx
and .pptx).  It's goal is to be the most compatible and highest performance Go
library for creation and editing of docx/xlsx/pptx files.

Requires **go1.8+**, builds are tested with 1.8, 1.9 and tip.

## Performance ##

There has been a great deal of interest in performance numbers for spreadsheet
creation/reading lately, so here are gooxml numbers for this
[benchmark](https://github.com/baliance/gooxml/tree/master/_examples/spreadsheet/lots-of-rows)
which creates a sheet with 30k rows, each with 100 columns.

    creating 30000 rows * 100 cells took 3.92506863s
    saving took 89ns
    reading took 9.522383048s

Creation is fairly fast, saving is very quick due to no reflection usage, and
reading is a bit slower. The downside is that the binary is large (33MB) as it
contains generated structs, serialization and deserialization code for all of
DOCX/XLSX/PPTX.

## Installation ##

## Raw Types ##

The OOXML specification is large and creating a friendly API to cover the entire
specification is a very time consuming endeavor.  This library attempts to
provide an easy to use API for common use cases in creating OOXML documents
while allowing users to fall back to raw document manipulation should the
library's API not cover a specific use case.

The raw XML based types reside in the ```schema/``` directory. These types are
accessible from the wrapper types via a ```X()``` method that returns the raw
type. 

For example, the library currently doesn't have an API for setting a document
background color. However it's easy to do manually via editing the
```CT_Background``` element of the document.

    dox := document.New()
    doc.X().Background = wordprocessingml.NewCT_Background()
	doc.X().Background.ColorAttr = &wordprocessingml.ST_HexColor{}
	doc.X().Background.ColorAttr.ST_HexColorRGB = color.RGB(50, 50, 50).AsRGBString()
