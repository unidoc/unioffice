## Status ##

The current focus is on documents (.docx). Some other code exists for
spreadsheets and presentations, but it is even less complete.  The current plan
is to get documents working well, then spreadsheets, and finally presentations.


## Installation ##
    
    go get baliance.com/gooxml/
    go build baliance.com/gooxml/...

## Raw Types ##

The OOXML specification is large and creating a friendly API to cover the entire
specification is a very time consuming endeavor.  This library attempts to
provide an easy to use API for common use cases in creating OOXML documents
while allowing users to fall back to raw document manipulation should the
library's API not cover a specific use case.

The raw XML based types reside in the ```schema/``` directory. These types are
accessible from the wrapper types via a ```X()``` method that returns the raw
type. 

For example, the library currently doesn't have an API for setting a document
background color. However it's easy to do manually via editing the
```CT_Background``` element of the document.

    dox := document.New()
    doc.X().Background = wordprocessingml.NewCT_Background()
	doc.X().Background.ColorAttr = &wordprocessingml.ST_HexColor{}
	doc.X().Background.ColorAttr.ST_HexColorRGB = color.RGB(50, 50, 50).AsRGBString()
